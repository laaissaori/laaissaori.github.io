Welcome to my architecture portfolio. I’m Lais Saori Kawagoe, an architect who loves designing spaces that are both beautiful and practical. My work is about finding the right balance between how things look and how they function.

In this portfolio, you’ll see a variety of projects I’ve worked on. Each one shows my focus on good design, attention to detail, and care for the environment. Whether it’s a home, a business, or a public building, I aim to create spaces that improve people’s lives.

I believe in designing places that people can truly enjoy and feel connected to. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and seeing the ideas and creativity I bring to each project.

Thank you for visiting.
